## Using ggplot for communication

3.1 Labels: good label on plots help communicate key findings, or even comply with the formatiing requirements of any outlet

In ggplot2, you add labels with the labs() function. Letâ€™s start with a title.

```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se.e = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Fuel efficiency generally decreases with engine size")
  ```

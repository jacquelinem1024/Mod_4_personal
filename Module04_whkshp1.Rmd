###Loading packages

First you will need to install the tidyverse. Make sure you run this in R console. You may have to update your R. 

```r 
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

The mpg data frame in ggplot2 is a dataset with observations (234 rows of data) and variables (in the columns). 

##Creating first ggplot
To create the first plot of this dataset. Using ggplot2, you can plot the data (data = mpg) and then put the size of the engine (displ) on the x axis and the fuel efficiency (hwy) on the y axis. 

```r
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

##Understaning the grammar of graphics

#Graphing Template

ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))


ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class))
- note mapped color to class

now change point sizes

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
#> Warning: Using size for a discrete variable is not advised. 

change point transparency.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

chnage point shape by class

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
